Question 1:
edate, starttime -> duration, URL, description, host
edate, starttime, panelistname -> panelistemail
participantid -> participantname, participantemail, participantaddress
edate, starttime, participantid -> ticketprice

NOT in BCNF,  edate, starttime -> duration, URL, description, host violates our rules. (LHF is not a superkey and this relation is not trivial)
NOT in 3NF, edate, starttime -> duration, URL, description, host violates our rules. (RHS is not a prime attribute)

Question 2:
F = {AC -> D, AC -> E, BE -> F, AFG -> B}
R1(A,B,C,F,G)    F1 = {AFG -> B}
R2(A,B,C,D,E)    F2 = {AC -> D, AC -> E}
F1 Union F2 = {AFG -> B, AC -> D, AC -> E}
From the result F1 Union F2, we can see that relation BE -> F hs missing, thus, we can conclude that this decomposition is not dependency preserving.

Question 3:
F = {AC -> BD, BC -> E, BE -> DF, AG -> EB}
R1(A,B,C,D)
R2(A,B,C,E,G)
R3(B,E,F)
R4(A,G,E)

A,  B,  C,  D,  E1, F1, G1
A,  B,  C,  D1, E,  F2, G
A1, B,  C1, D2, E,  F,  G2
A,  B1, C2, D3, E,  F3, G

AC -> BD
A,  B,  C,  D,  E1, F1, G1
A,  B,  C,  D,  E,  F2, G
A1, B,  C1, D2, E,  F,  G2
A,  B1, C2, D3, E,  F3, G

BC -> E
A,  B,  C,  D,  E,  F1, G1
A,  B,  C,  D,  E,  F2, G
A1, B,  C1, D2, E,  F,  G2
A,  B1, C2, D3, E,  F3, G

BE -> DF
A,  B,  C,  D,  E,  F,  G1
A,  B,  C,  D,  E,  F,  G
A1, B,  C1, D2, E,  F,  G2
A,  B1, C2, D3, E,  F3, G

Since we have cleared everything unknown in row2, we can conclude that this decomposition is lossless.

Question 4:
F = {AD -> CE, C -> D, BEF -> G, AG -> G}
(a) ABFGH, ABCFH, ABDFH, ABEFH 
It is in 3NF since our RHS are all prime attributes.

(b) Done

(c) Done

Question 5:
F = {AC -> BD, BC -> BE, ABC -> E}

Step1:
F = {AC -> B, AC -> D,BC -> B, BC -> E, ABC -> E}

Step2:
F = {AC -> B, AC -> D, BC -> E, ABC -> E}

Step3:
F = {AC -> B, AC -> D, BC -> E}

Final Result:
F = {AC -> B, AC -> D, BC -> E}

Question 6:
Key: oname, mid

If we go through all relations, we find out that all of them violate BCNF.
Thus, we need to craete two new relation instead of R:
R1 = {cname df url email}
R2 = {cname mid mname oname opositon}

BCNF check:
R1 satisfies BCNF              F1 = {cname -> df url email}
R2 does not satisfies BCNF     F2 = {cname mid -> mname, oname -> oposition, oname -> cname}

Since R2 does not satisfy BCNF, we have to decomposte it as previous one.
R21 = {cname mid mname}             F1 = {cname mid -> mname}
R22 = {cname mid oname oposition}   F2 = {oname -> oposition, oname -> cname}

BCNF check:
R21 satisfies BCNF             F21 = {cname mid -> mname}
R22 does not satisfies BCNF    F22 = {oname -> oposition, oname -> cname}

Since R22 does not satisfy BCNF, we have to decomposte it as previous one.
R221 = {oname oposition cname}       F221 = {oname -> oposition, oname -> cname}
R222 = {mid oname}                   F222 = {}

BCNF check:
R221 satisfies BCNF             F221 = {oname -> oposition, oname -> cname}
R222 does not satisfies BCNF    F222 = {}

Thus:
R1 = {cname df url email}
R21 = {cname mid mname}    
R221 = {oname oposition cname}
R222 = {mid oname}

Question 6. what to expect to prove the lossy decomposition?
